# fretlearner-python
## A simple tool for learning notes on the guitar fretboard.
I wrote this program to help me find any note on all strings (up to the 12th fret, standard tuning). This really helps with improvisation.
You can decide which string(s) to practice.

## Usage:
Terminal: py fretlearner.py
